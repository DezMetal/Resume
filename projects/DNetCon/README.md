# DNetCon

Workflow orchestration system for chaining programs via file-based IPC.

## Overview
Build automated pipelines that connect any applications. Define workflows with triggers (scheduled, file-watch, or voice via Aether), chain commands with conditional logic, and let plugins auto-generate their own web UI.

## Key Features
- **File-based IPC** - universal communication between any programs
- **Multiple trigger types**: Schedule, file change, manual, voice command
- **Conditional logic** - if/then/else branching within pipelines
- **Plugin architecture** - programs auto-register and generate UI
- **Variable substitution** - pass data between pipeline steps

## Technologies
- Python | Flask | Watchdog | Schedule | Alpine.js | Dynamic UI generation
