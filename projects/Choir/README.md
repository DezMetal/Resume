Experimental autonomous AI with continuous cognitive loop.

## Overview
An exploration of autonomous AI systems - local LLMs running in a continuous cognitive loop, processing without waiting for prompts. Experimental work investigating self-directed AI behavior.

## Key Features
- **Local LLMs** - runs entirely on local hardware
- **Continuous loop** - processes without human prompts
- **GGUF models** - efficient quantized model loading
- **Autonomous design** - self-directed cognitive flow
- **Experimental** - research into AI autonomy patterns
