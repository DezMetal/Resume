# DNetAva

Secure API-based interaction layer for 3D environments.

## Overview
Any application can control a 3D avatar through authenticated REST/WebSocket payloads. Decoupled architecture means the avatar system exists independently - just send commands and watch the scene respond.

## Key Features
- **Decoupled API** - control avatar from any application
- **REST + WebSocket** - both request/response and real-time patterns
- **JWT-secured endpoints** - authentication for all interactions
- **Three.js frontend** - web-based 3D rendering
- **StreamAudio submodule** - integrated TTS for avatar speech

## Technologies
- Python | Flask | Three.js | WebSocket | JWT | Git submodules
