# PureNums

Quantum random number generator with cryptographic purification.

## Overview
Generate unbiased number sets derived from quantum vacuum fluctuations. Raw entropy from the ANU Quantum API is purified through SHA-256 hashing to ensure statistical uniformity. Includes validation benchmarking to verify randomness quality.

## Key Features
- **ANU Quantum API** - real quantum entropy source
- **SHA-256 purification** - cryptographic hashing for uniformity
- **Statistical validation** - benchmark testing against known distributions
- **Configurable sets** - specify size, count, and max values
- **CLI interface** - command-line generation and validation
